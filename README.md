### OVERVIEW

The Template Manager allows users to create, view, and use document templates for their files via a simple and intuitive interface.

### SETUP AND USE

The following is the recommended procedure for setting up and using the Template Manager:

1. Access the directory that the executable is found in: `\template-manager\bin\Debug`
2. Look for the `template_manager.exe` executable file and right-click on it
3. When the right-click options appear, select Send To > Desktop (Create Shortcut) and a shortcut icon should appear on your Desktop
4. To launch the application, simply double-click the shortcut (you can freely rename and move the shortcut elsewhere)

### Reflection

At the time of making this project, I did not have a good grasp of MVVM or MVC code structure so I would have liked to implement that in this project. Perhaps I will tackle that in a future revision if I revisit this.
